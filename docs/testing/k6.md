# Performance Testing with k6

## 1. Overview

k6 is a modern load testing tool for assessing the performance and reliability of our APIs. We use k6 to simulate traffic and identify performance bottlenecks before they impact users.

## 2. Writing Tests

Performance tests are located in the `apps/backend/performance` directory. Tests are written in JavaScript and use the k6 API to define scenarios, thresholds, and checks.

## 3. Running Tests

To run a performance test, use the following command from the root directory, replacing `auth.test.js` with the name of the test file you want to run:

```bash
npm run test:performance -- apps/backend/performance/auth.test.js
